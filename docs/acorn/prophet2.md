## At power-on

Built into the platform kernel, awaiting hardware verification — no boot capture yet, so no boot behaviour is claimed here.

## Required assets

- `roms/prophet2.zip`

  | ROM | CRC32 |
  |---|---|

## Notes

- MAME driver: `atom.cpp`.
- MAME clone of `atom` (Atom) — the system macro's parent field in the driver source. The ROM table above lists every member this machine's own zip needs.
